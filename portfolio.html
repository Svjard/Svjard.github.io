            <strong>Tools Portal/User Management</strong>
            <p>Provides user management, SSO, and ability for outside access for limited time to certain customers. Responsive design using Bootstrap and Backbone.js on the front-end. Password is hashed on the client-side and then bcrypt is used on the hash before being stored. We use the user provided information to in-depth tracking/analytics on the tools to see which organizations use what, how they use the tools, when, and find trends to provide more accurate training, funding, and information.</p>

            <strong>Svenson - Power/Floorspace Environmental Modeling Tool</strong>
            <p>Designed to model data centers from the perspective of understanding environmentals. Produces a nicely branded output for customers to see comparison of costs and consilidation. Uses three.js with lots of added custom code. Was extended to handle live monitoring of systems, hoping in the future to improve the overall design, data center planning and forecasting, inventory tracking, and expand to a full offerring potentially.</p>

            <strong>Howitzer - A generic process flow tool<strong>
            <p>Designed to solve an internal problem with providing an audit trail and ability to get live notifications for processes. This can include travel approval, extensions for system use, special permissioning, and many others. Express.js, Backbone.js, MongoDB, node-mailer (responsive email layouts), and a few other libraries. Has had a big impact on the business for such a minor overall tool.</p>

          <p>
            <strong>Jughead - Services analytics tool</strong>
            <p>A fun project using node-webkit to build a standalone tool for customer and professional services to perform ad-hoc analysis against various systems to find potential bottlenecks and engagment oppurtunities. Currently benchmarking atom-shell to replace node-webkit but not commited to it yet. Uses NeDB for data storage which is an interesting technology and ssh2 for getting lots of command line data from the systems (allows for jumping through multiple systems to get a specific system to run commands against). The pivot tables are custom but the charts are built using d3.js. Can be run without a GUI as well. Originally written in Java and quickly created a new line of revenue for the company. Screenshots coming soon.</p>
