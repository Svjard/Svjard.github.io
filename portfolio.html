            <strong>Archie</strong>
            <p>This is our core sales tool used for sizing systems, understanding performance, pricing, designing next generation platforms, staging systems, and configuring system on-site. It supports the entire product portfolio that Teradata has and is continually expanding. It uses Node.js on the server-side, Backbone.js with Backbone Marionette on the client-side and leverages MongoDB for its data source.</p>

            <strong>Teradata Differentiate</strong>
            <p>A unique tool used by sales and marketing to compare various database platforms at a high level. It provides talking points that help generate useful direction for sales to communicating strengths and weaknesses of platforms with new and existing customers. The tool allows users to share their content, rate content, and even generate their own content if they have expertise on a platform or attribute that doesn't exist. Works well on desktop and mobile as well as providing well branded PDF exports for customers to take with them. Also has a full API that other tools can integrate with.</p>

            <strong>Svenson - Power/Floorspace Environmental Modeling Tool</strong>
            <p>Designed to model data centers from the perspective of understanding environmentals. Produces a nicely branded output for customers to see comparison of costs and consilidation. Uses three.js with lots of added custom code. Was extended to handle live monitoring of systems, hoping in the future to improve the overall design, data center planning and forecasting, inventory tracking, and expand to a full offerring potentially. Was built over the course of one month in spare cycles.</p>

            <strong>Howitzer - A generic process flow tool<strong>
            <p>Designed to solve an internal problem with providing an audit trail and ability to get live notifications for processes. This can include travel approval, extensions for system use, special permissioning, and many others. Express.js, Backbone.js, MongoDB, node-mailer (responsive email layouts), and a few other libraries. Has had a big impact on the business for such a minor overall tool.</p>

            <strong>Midge</strong>
            <p>A self-service, multi-org, help desk built on Angular.js, MongoDB, and Node.js. It was specifically built to handle mobile well as well as provide unique group hierarchies. Often we have groups within groups (sometimes nested 4 levels down) and therefore the tool has a built in concept of group hierarchies and permissions across them accordingly. Websockets drive the majority of the events providing real-time collaboration between users. It also has its own knowledge base where the backend constantly scans tickets to find similiarities and suggests to groups a new new FAQ could be added to alleviate repetitive tickets. The tickets themselves are dynamic based on the needs of the groups and do not require programmer interaction to handle setting up the wizard and rules. The eventual hope is that higher level managers and even VPs can get direct notices about specific issues in real-time, alleviating the need for them to catch up on the history of an issue until late in the game.</p>

            <strong>Jughead - Services analytics tool</strong>
            <p>A fun project using node-webkit to build a standalone tool for customer and professional services to perform ad-hoc analysis against various systems to find potential bottlenecks and engagment oppurtunities. Currently benchmarking atom-shell to replace node-webkit but not commited to it yet. Uses NeDB for data storage which is an interesting technology and ssh2 for getting lots of command line data from the systems (allows for jumping through multiple systems to get a specific system to run commands against). The pivot tables are custom but the charts are built using d3.js. Can be run without a GUI as well. Originally written in Java and quickly created a new line of revenue for the company. Screenshots coming soon.</p>
